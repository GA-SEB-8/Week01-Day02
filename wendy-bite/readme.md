Your client, Wendy, has created "pixel-perfect" images representing how she
wants her website to look, and provided the text. Make her site!

- Git
- HTML
- CSS

## Special Characters

You will notice that certain characters do not render properly. For example,
this appears in the header: `RÃ©sumÃ©`. You need to fix this! Start by Googling
"strange HTML characters".

it to look like this mock:

The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and one divorcée) sharing a house in Miami, Florida. The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund (Wendy Bite) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur). They both responded to a room-for-rent ad on the bulletin board of a local grocery store. In the pilot episode, the women had a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently removed.[5] The three were soon joined by Dorothy"s mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.
