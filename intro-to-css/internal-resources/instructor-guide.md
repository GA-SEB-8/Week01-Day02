  <span class="headline">Intro to CSS</span>
  <span class="subhead">Instructor Guide</span>
</h1>

## General overview

If you are familiar with the legacy Intro to CSS content this version will intentionally feel much lighter.

The intention here is to get students going with just enough knowledge to be dangerous and explore CSS without being overwhelmed by a multitude of options available to them.

Hints at future content are dropped along the way so students have a framework of where to potentially explore next if they're curious or run into blockers.
